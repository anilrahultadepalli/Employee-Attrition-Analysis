3. Key Components
3.1 Data Preprocessing
Function: preprocess_employee_data(data, feature_columns=None)
Cleans and processes employee data:
Encodes categorical variables.
Fills missing values.
Drops irrelevant columns (EmployeeNumber, Over18, etc.).
Ensures feature consistency using feature_columns.
3.2 Machine Learning
Model: Random Forest Classifier
Function: train_model()
Reads employee data (WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv).
Preprocesses the dataset.
Splits data into training/testing sets.
Trains a Random Forest model.
Outputs the model, feature columns, and raw data.
3.3 Email Notification
Function: send_email_notification(high_risk_employees)
Sends an email to notify about high-risk employees.
Uses Gmailâ€™s SMTP server for sending emails.
3.4 Visualization
Department Satisfaction Analysis:

Function: plot_department_analysis(grouped_data)
Generates bar plots for:
Average tenure.
Average job satisfaction.
Average performance rating.
Attrition Trend:

Function: /attrition-trend-graph
Creates a bar chart for average attrition probability by department.
